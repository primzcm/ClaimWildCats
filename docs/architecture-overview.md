# Architecture Overview

## Front-end (React + Vite)

- Routing is defined in `frontend/src/router.jsx`, matching the sitemap for guests, users, and admins.
- `PageLayout` provides a reusable shell for each page while you iteratively build cards, tables, and forms.
- Extend the placeholder screens with feature components (filters, carousels, chat threads) and call the REST API via `fetch` or a query library.

## Back-end (Spring Boot)

- API endpoints live inside `controller/` packages, grouped by domain (items, claims, users, admin).
- Services currently emit stub data to unblock UI development. Replace them with Firestore queries using the `FirebaseFacade` helper.
- `FirebaseConfig` wires the Admin SDK. Toggle `firebase.enabled` to skip cloud initialization during local development.
- `SecurityConfig` currently permits all requests so you can prototype quickly. Introduce JWT/ID token validation before production.
- OpenAPI definitions are auto-generated by springdoc-openapi, available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

## Suggested modules

| Concern            | Suggested Location                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Firestore schemas  | `backend/src/main/java/com/claimwildcats/api/domain`   |
| Validation & DTOs  | `backend/src/main/java/com/claimwildcats/api/dto`      |
| Auth middleware    | `backend/src/main/java/com/claimwildcats/api/security` |
| Background jobs    | `backend/src/main/java/com/claimwildcats/api/jobs`     |
| Shared constants   | `backend/src/main/java/com/claimwildcats/api/support`  |

## Data flow (happy path)

1. A student reports a lost item via the React form (`/items/new/lost`).
2. Front-end calls `POST /api/items/lost` with metadata and uploaded photo URLs.
3. `ItemController` delegates to `ItemService`, which will write to `Firestore` and emit match events.
4. Finders browse `/` or `/search`, see matches, and open details from `/api/items/{id}`.
5. Claims are submitted through `POST /api/items/{itemId}/claims` and reviewed by admins via `PATCH /api/claims/{claimId}/decision`.

This structure keeps responsibilities separated so multiple team members can work in parallel without stepping on each other.
